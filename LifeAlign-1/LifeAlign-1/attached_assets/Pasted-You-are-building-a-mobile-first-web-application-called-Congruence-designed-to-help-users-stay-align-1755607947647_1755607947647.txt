You are building a mobile-first web application called Congruence, designed to help users stay aligned with their long-term goals and identity by using AI-driven questioning, habit creation, and progress tracking. Please generate the scaffolding, frontend, backend, and basic AI integration.

üì± Platform & Tech Stack
Build as a mobile-first responsive web app (PWA-capable so it can be installed like a mobile app).

Use React (Next.js or Vite with React) for the frontend.

Use Node.js/Express (or Next.js API routes) for backend logic.

Store user data (goals, habits, progress) in a lightweight DB such as Supabase/PostgreSQL (or Firebase if simpler).

Include authentication via Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth (email & social login).

AI reasoning and question generation should integrate with OpenAI or a similar LLM API (abstract calls into a backend route).

üîë User Flow
Login / Signup Page

Simple, clean sign-in/sign-up page.

Support Google + Email login.

First-Time User Onboarding (AI Blueprint Creation)

After login, new users are prompted by an AI-powered Q&A flow:

Direct questions: "Who do you want to become?" "What traits matter to you?"

Indirect questions: lifestyle, career, relationships, personal growth.

Output of Q&A = "Blueprint" ‚Üí JSON structure containing:

identity_goal (who they want to be)

current_state (where they are now)

focus_areas (e.g., career, social life, fitness)

daily_habits (AI-generated)

Save blueprint to user database.

Main Dashboard ("Who You Want To Be")

Daily landing page shows:

Their identity goal (reminder of their blueprint).

Motivational/engaging design (inspiring background, minimalist UI).

Tabs/links to:

Daily Habits Section

Blueprint Section (view/adjust)

Progress Tracking Section

Daily Habits Section

List of habits generated from the blueprint.

Users can mark them as complete (checkbox or swipe action).

Track streaks and completions in DB.

Blueprint Section

Displays the personal blueprint summary.

"Adjust with AI" button ‚Üí calls AI again with user updates to refine daily habits or goals.

Progress Tracking Section

Visual metrics (simple charts/graphs) on focus areas user defined in blueprint.

Progress determined by:

Habit completion rate

Self-assessment prompts (weekly check-ins)

Example metrics: Charisma ‚úÖ Career ‚úÖ Fitness ‚úÖ

üé® Design & Feel
Minimalist, focused on clarity.

Engaging but simple: soft color gradients, a background image/theme that changes slightly depending on progress.

Typography should feel motivating & clean (Roboto, Inter, or Poppins).

‚öôÔ∏è Core Features to Implement
Authentication (Supabase/Firebase).

AI integration (OpenAI API for questioning, blueprint refinement, and habit generation).

Habit storage + completion tracking.

Progress metrics calculation.

Blueprint storage & retrieval.

Mobile-optimized layout (works primarily for phones).

PWA configuration so users can "install" the app to their home screen.

‚úÖ Deliverables in Initial Build
Code scaffold for frontend + backend.

Example onboarding flow with mock AI prompts (hardcode JSON if AI API not set up yet).

Basic habit list UI with checkboxes.

Progress dashboard using mock data.

Database model stubs for users, blueprints, habits, progress.

Authentication integrated and working.

Once this scaffold is generated, we can expand on:

AI refinement & better blueprinting.

Push/local notifications for daily habit reminders.

Social features (optional: share progress with friends).

üëâ Instruction to Replit: Please start by generating the full-stack scaffold of this app with the above requirements. Include working authentication, dummy AI integration placeholders, and basic UI navigation between Login ‚Üí Onboarding ‚Üí Main Dashboard ‚Üí Habits ‚Üí Blueprint ‚Üí Progress.
